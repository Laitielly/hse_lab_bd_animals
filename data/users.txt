To work with the animals database, you need to provide another database through which using the dblink utility.

Initially, only the creator user has the right to work with tables, functions and procedures in the logs database.

Therefore, for full-fledged work, the logs database itself and the creator user with the rights granted by the user were created by the root user.

The following commands were created through root (in addition to those in the logs_database.sql file).

-- root in logs.
CREATE ROLE rights_for_creator WITH
		NOSUPERUSER CREATEDB CREATEROLE NOINHERIT NOREPLICATION;
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE logs to rights_for_creator;
ALTER ROLE rights_for_creator CREATEROLE;
ALTER ROLE rights_for_creator LOGIN;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO rights_for_creator;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO rights_for_creator;
GRANT UPDATE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO rights_for_creator;
GRANT EXECUTE ON ALL FUNCTIONS IN SCHEMA public TO rights_for_creator;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO rights_for_creator;
GRANT INSERT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO rights_for_creator;

CREATE USER creator WITH PASSWORD 'bkppasswd';
GRANT rights_for_creator TO creator;
ALTER ROLE creator CREATEROLE;
alter user creator createdb;
grant pg_signal_backend to creator;

CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE grant_to_animals()
	LANGUAGE SQL
		AS $$
			GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE animals to rights_for_creator;
		$$;

After that, we connect the creator user to dblink. Now he is the creator of the animals database and has the right to distribute rights to it and delete it. \
-- We connect to the creative and forget about root.
CREATE USER client WITH PASSWORD 'client';
CREATE ROLE rights_for_client WITH
		NOSUPERUSER NOCREATEDB NOCREATEROLE INHERIT NOREPLICATION;

It is important that after deleting the animals database, all rights will be taken away from the client.
-- Therefore, after a new database creation, you should call the procedure for granting client rights on behalf of the creator.
call create_role_client();

Next, we work in the usual mode with the logs and animals database.
